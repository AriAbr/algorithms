1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:
- Making coffee;
- Washing dishes;
- A choice of your own. -- Folding Laundry

FUNCTION makeCoffee(water, instantCoffee, sweetener, milk)
  SET water.temperature to 212
  SET cup to empty array
  ADD water to cup
  ADD instantCoffee to cup
  ADD sweetener to cup
  ADD milk to cup
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION washDishes(sink)
  FOR each dish in sink
    SET currentDish to dish
    RINSE currentDish
    SCRUB currentDish
    RINSE currentDish
    REMOVE currentDish from sink
    ADD currentDish to drying rack
  END FOR
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION foldLaundry(laundryPile)
  SET shirtPile to empty array
  SET pantsPile to empty array
  SET underwearPile to empty array
  SET sockPile to empty array

  set singleSocks to empty array

  FOR each clothingArticle in laundryPile
    SET currentArticle toclothingArticle
    REMOVE currentArticle from laundryPile
    IF currentArticle.type equals shirt
      CALL foldShirt with currentArticle
      ADD currentArticle to shirtPile
    ELSE IF currentArticle.type equals pants
      CALL foldPants with currentArticle
      ADD currentArticle to pantsPile
    ELSE IF currentArticle.type equals underwear
      ADD currentArticle to underwearPile
    ELSE IF currentArticle.type equals sock
      FOR each sock in singleSocks
        IF sock.sockType equals currentArticle.sockType
        CALL foldSocks with sock and currentArticle RETURNING sockPair
        ADD sockPair to sockPile
      END FOR
    ELSE
      ADD currentArticle to singleSocks
    END IF
  END FOR
END FUNCTION


2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the
problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name
three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g.,
Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a
recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant
results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand
out?

Amazon has created a successful logistics algorithm that effectively manages and
keeps track of a huge number of deliveries. Facebook has created a successful
algorithm to determine which posts to show at the top of a user's newsfeed. Uber
has created a successful algorithm to determine which users should get paired
with which drivers.


3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an
inefficient algorithm.

An efficient algorithm is as fast and memory-efficient as possible. An
inefficient algorithm will either take more time then necessary to complete or
use up more memory than necessary while it is running.
