# Short Answer

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Looking through a shuffled deck of cards to find a particular card.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Looking through a book to find the right page. It is not exactly the same as
binary search, but a similar idea. You open a book to somewhere in the middle,
see what page you are on, then flip either forward or backward depending on what
page you are looking for.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

7 iterations

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

3 iterations

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

I would use linear search since binary search only works with sorted
collections.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

I would use binary search. Since the collection is sorted binary search is an
available option and it is faster than linear search.

# Programming Assignment

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in
the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function dictionarySearch (dictionary, targetWord) {
  var low = 0;
  var high = dictionary.length-1;
  while (low <= high) {
    var mid = Math.round((low+high)/2);
    var midPage = dictionary[mid];

    if (midPage[0].localeCompare(targetWord) > 0) {
      high = mid-1;
    } else if (midPage[midPage.length-1].localeCompare(targetWord) < 0){
      low = mid+1;
    } else {
      return mid;
    }
  }
  return "not found";
}

var testDictionary = [
  [
    "abstruct", "accident", "add"
  ],[
    "Albatross", "Arkasas" ,"artichoke"
  ],[
     "car", "catastrope", "climb"
  ],[
    "dire", "dog", "dogmatic"
  ],
]

console.log(dictionarySearch(testDictionary, "Albatross"));


2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only
white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you
net the right fish.


function netFish(tank, spotColor) {
  var result = null;
  for(let i = 0; i < tank.length; i++) {
    var fish = tank[i];
    if(fish.spotColor === spotColor){
      result = i;
      break;
    }
  }
  return result;
};

var testTank = [
 {
   type: "goldfish",
   spotColor: null
 },
 {
   type: "goldfish",
   spotColor: "black"
 },
 {
   type: "goldfish",
   spotColor: "white"
 },
 {
   type: "goldfish",
   spotColor: null
 },
 {
   type: "goldfish",
   spotColor: "yellow"
 }
];

console.log(netFish(testTank, "white"));
